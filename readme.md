# Arch Linux installation on Windows

This repo contains information on how to set up a basic dual boot partition with Windows and Arch Linux in [how-to-install.md](how-to-install.md).

It also contains Arch Linux packages I like to use in [package.list](package.list).

It also contains an example partition setup in [sda.dump](sda.dump).
